## A Night of Joy and Reflection

On the evening of December 7th, the **YMCA Matara** hall was transformed for our annual Christmas Carol Service. This year’s theme, **"Saviour of the World,"** brought together members of all ages to celebrate the spirit of peace and hope that the season represents.

### Programme Highlights
* **The Processional:** The service began with a candlelight procession led by our Youth Wing, singing *"O Come, All Ye Faithful."*
* **Choral Performances:** The YMCA Matara Youth Choir performed a beautiful rendition of *"Going to Bethlehem,"* followed by a special guest performance by a local parish choir.
* **Scripture Lessons:** Nine lessons were read by various board members and youth representatives, tracing the story of the Nativity.
* **Candlelight Moment:** The hall was illuminated solely by handheld candles during a communal singing of *"Silent Night,"* creating a powerful moment of silent reflection.

> "Christmas at the YMCA is about more than just songs; it is about the community coming together as one family to share light in the darkness." — *General Secretary, YMCA Matara*
