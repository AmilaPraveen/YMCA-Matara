## Bridging the Digital Divide

The **YMCA Matara Vocational Training Centre** successfully launched its first "Digital Skills for the Future" certificate course of 2026. This initiative aims to provide school leavers in the Matara district with the essential technical skills required for the modern job market.

### Course Overview
The 6-month program is designed to take students from basic computer hardware knowledge to advanced office productivity tools and an introduction to AI-assisted work.

| Module | Key Skills Covered | Duration |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **ICT Basics** | Operating Systems, File Management, Hardware | 4 Weeks |
| **Office Suite** | Advanced Word Processing & Data Analysis | 8 Weeks |
| **Graphic Design** | Introduction to Canva and Photo Editing | 6 Weeks |
| **Digital Marketing** | Social Media Management & Online Branding | 4 Weeks |
| **Professional English** | Email Etiquette & Interview Skills | Ongoing |

### Why This Matters
According to recent employment data, over 70% of new jobs in the Southern Province now require a baseline of digital literacy. By providing these courses at a subsidized rate, the YMCA ensures that financial constraints do not stand in the way of a young person’s career.

## Success Stories
Last year, 85% of our vocational graduates found employment within three months of completing their training. We are proud to continue this tradition of excellence in 2026.
