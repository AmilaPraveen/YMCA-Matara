## Unplugging and Connecting with Nature

Our **Adventure Camp 2024** brought together 30 young leaders from across the Matara district for a three-day intensive retreat. This year, we focused on self-reliance, physical fitness, and the YMCA's core values.

### Key Camp Activities
* **Shelter Building:** Campers learned to construct emergency shelters using natural materials.
* **Navigation Challenge:** A team-based orienteering race using traditional compasses and maps.
* **Night Trekking:** A guided night hike to foster courage and sensory awareness.
* **Campfire Circle:** Each evening ended with songs, storytelling, and reflections.

> "The hardest part wasn't the hiking; it was learning to lead a team when everyone was tired." — *Sanath, Age 16*

## Skills Mastered
1. **First Aid:** Basic wound care and emergency transport techniques.
2. **Knot Tying:** Mastering the bowline and clove hitch.
3. **Environmental Ethics:** Following "Leave No Trace" principles.

We look forward to making the next camp even bigger and bolder!
