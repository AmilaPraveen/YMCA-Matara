## Standing Together in Times of Crisis

In response to the severe flooding caused by the overflowing Nilwala River this June, **YMCA Matara** mobilized an emergency relief mission to assist displaced families in the **Malimboda** and **Thihagoda** areas. Our volunteers worked tirelessly to ensure that those in temporary shelters received basic necessities.

### Relief Operations Summary
* **Emergency Meals:** Distributed over 500 cooked lunch packets to families stranded by rising water levels.
* **Dry Ration Packs:** Provided 120 families with essential kits containing rice, dhal, sugar, tea leaves, and milk powder.
* **Safe Water:** Delivered 200 liters of bottled drinking water to areas where local wells were contaminated.
* **Cleaning Assistance:** Once water levels receded, our Youth Wing assisted in cleaning mud and debris from three local primary schools to help children return to classes.

> "When the water entered our homes, the YMCA was among the first to arrive with hot meals and hope. We are grateful for the young volunteers who didn't hesitate to help." — *Local Resident*
