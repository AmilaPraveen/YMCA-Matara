## Cleaning the Shore for a Greener Tomorrow

Today, the **YMCA Matara** youth wing organized a successful beach cleaning drive along the **Matara Beach Park** coastline. As part of our commitment to the national "Clean Sri Lanka" efforts, over 40 volunteers gathered at sunrise to protect our marine ecosystem.

### Event Highlights
* **Teamwork:** We collaborated with local university students and community members.
* **Waste Collection:** Successfully removed over 150kg of plastic waste and glass debris.
* **Segregation:** All waste was sorted on-site to ensure PET bottles were sent to local recycling centers.
* **Awareness:** Conducted a brief session for beach-goers on the impact of microplastics on our southern marine life.

> "A clean beach isn't just about tourism; it's about preserving the natural heritage of Matara for the next generation of youth." — *Project Coordinator*
