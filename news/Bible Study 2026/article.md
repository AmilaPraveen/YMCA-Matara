## Starting the Year with the Word

Our first Bible Study of 2026 was held this Wednesday at the YMCA Matara chapel. As we enter a new year, our focus was on the theme **"Walk with Me,"** exploring how we can align our personal lives with God's mission for the Matara community.

### Study Focus: John 17:21
*"That all of them may be one, Father, just as you are in me and I am in you."*

We discussed how "Unity" is not just a religious concept but a practical requirement for our youth work. When we work together—whether in beach cleanings or flood relief—we reflect the unity that Jesus prayed for.

### Discussion Key Points
* **Personal Growth:** How "Walking with Christ" in 2026 means making ethical choices in our schools and workplaces.
* **Community Impact:** Applying the "Salt and Light" principle to the specific challenges faced by families in the Southern Province.
* **Steward Leadership:** Understanding that our talents and the YMCA resources are a "stewardship" entrusted to us to serve others.

> "To walk with God is to move in the direction of justice and service. This year, we aim to make our faith visible through our actions in Matara." — *Youth Coordinator*

## Reflection Questions for the Week
1. In what area of your life do you need to seek more 'Unity' this month?
2. How can our YMCA branch better serve the 'marginalized' in our own neighborhood?
3. What is one practical way you can be 'Light' in a difficult situation this week?
